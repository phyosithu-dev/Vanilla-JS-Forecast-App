About The Project

This project was built to practice modern front-end development techniques without relying on any frameworks. It's a demonstration of how to work with third-party APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript operations, and create a visually engaging and responsive user interface through advanced CSS and DOM manipulation.

The core idea is to make a weather app that not only tells you the weather but feels like the weather through smart, subtle color cues.
Features

    Live Weather Data: Get up-to-the-minute weather information for any city, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a "feels like" temperature.

    Dynamic Icon Coloring: All weather icons across the application change their color to match the current conditions (e.g., warm yellows for "Clear", cool blues for "Rain"), providing an intuitive and beautiful visual cue.

    Hourly & 5-Day Forecasts: Plan ahead with a scrollable 24-hour hourly forecast and a 5-day forecast summary.

    Sleek Dark-Themed UI: A professional and easy-to-read dark theme that makes the colorful icons pop.

    Responsive Design: A clean, mobile-first design that looks great on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

    Built with Modern JS: Uses modern JavaScript features like async/await and Promise.all for efficient, readable asynchronous code.

Built With
